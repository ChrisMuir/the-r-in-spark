intends to take someone unfamiliar with Spark or R and help them become
intermediate users by teaching a set of tools, skills and practices
applicable to data science.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}}

This chapters covers the historical background that lead to the
development of Spark, introduces R in the context of Spark and
\texttt{sparklyr} as a project bridging Spark and R.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology}{Humans have
been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information
since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC}.
Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is
possible to distinguish four distinct phases development: pre-mechanical
(3000 BC -- 1450 AD), mechanical (1450--1840), electromechanical
(1840--1940), and electronic (1940--present).

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age}{As humanity moves
from traditional industries to an economy based on information
technology} our footprint of digital information has kept growing at
\href{http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/896971468194972881/310436360_201602630200201/additional/102725-PUB-Replacement-PUBLIC.pdf}{exponential

\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-1}World's capacity to store information.}
\end{figure}

With the ambition to provide a searchable tool to all this new digital
information, many companies attempted to provide such functionality with
what we now know as web search or search engines. Managing information
at this scale was a challenging problem that companies had to tackle
from the very beginning. Given the vast amount of digital information,
search engiens were unble to store all the web page information required
to support web searches in a single computer. This meant that they had
to split information across many machines, which was accomlished by
splitting this data and storing it as many files across many machines,
this approach became known as the Google File System from a research
paper published in 2003 by Google which has served for others to build
on.

One year later, in 2004, Google published a new paper describing how to
perform operations across the Google File System, this approach came to
be known as \textbf{MapReduce}. As you would expect, there are two
operations in MapReduce: Map and Reduce. We can think of the mapping
operation as a way to transform each file into a new file and, reuduce
as a way of combining two files into a new one. It happens to be the
case that using these two operations is sufficient to perform
interesting operations; for instance, MapReduce can be used to rank web
pages efficietly across a cluster of machines.

Since the papers were released by Google, a team in Yahoo worked on
implementing the Google File System and MapReduce as free open source
projects. This project was released in 2006 as \textbf{Hadoop} and the
Google File System became implemented as the Hadoop File System, or HDFS
for short. The Hadoop project made distributed file-based computing
accessible to many users and organizations.

While Hadoop provided support to perform map/reduce operations over a
distributed file system, it still required each map/reduce operation to
be written with code every time a data analysys was run. The
\textbf{Hive} project, released in 2008 by Facebook, brought Structured
Query Language (SQL) support to Hadoop. This meant that data analysis
could now be performed at large-scale without the need to write code for
each map/reduce operation, but instead, one could write generic data
analysis statements that are much easier to understand and write.

\hypertarget{spark}{%
\section{Spark}\label{spark}}

While Hadoop with Hive was a powerful tool, it was still working over a
distributed file system and was dependent on map/reduce operations. This
meant that it was running using disk drives which tend to be
significantly slower than using a computer's memory. In 2009, the
\textbf{Apache Spark} projects starts in Berkeley to improve over
Hadoop. Specifically, by making use of memory (instead of disk drives)
and by providing a richer set of verbs beyond map/reduce, this allowed
it to be much faster and generic than its predecessor. For instance, one
can
\href{https://databricks.com/blog/2014/11/05/spark-officially-sets-a-new-record-in-large-scale-sorting.html}{sort
100TB of data in 72min and 2100 computers using Hadoop, but only 206
computers in 23min using Spark}. Spark was build using the Scala
programming language, but interfaces to other programming languages are
also provided today. Spark was released as an open source project in
2010 with the scope of the project defined as follows:

\begin{quote}
``Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data
processing.''

--- \href{http://spark.apache.org/}{spark.apache.org}
\end{quote}

meaning that Spark is a tool designed to support:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Data Processing}: Data processing is the collection and
  manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information
  \citep{data-processing}.
\item
  \textbf{Large-Scale}: What \emph{large} means is hard to quantify, but
  one can interpret this as cluster-scale instead, which represents a
  set of connected computers that work together.
\item
  \textbf{General}: Spark optimizes and executes parallel generic code,
  as in, there is no restriction as to what type of code one can write
  in Spark.
\item
  \textbf{Fast}: Spark is much faster than its predecessor by making
  efficient use of memory to speed data access while running algorithms
  at scale.
\end{itemize}

Spark is good at tackling large-scale data processing problems, this
usually known as \textbf{big data}
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_data}{data sets that are more
voluminous and complex that traditional ones}, but also is good at
tackling large-scale computation problems, known as \textbf{big compute}
(\href{https://www.nimbix.net/glossary/big-compute/}{tools and
approaches using a large amount of CPU and memory resources in a
coordinated way}). There is a third problem space where data nor compute
are necessarily large scale and yet, there are significant benefits from
using the same tools.

Big data and big compute problems are usually easy to spot, if the data
does not fit into a single machine, you might have a big data problem;
if the data fits into a single machine but a process over the data takes
days, weeks or months to compute, you might have a big compute problem.

For the third problem space, there are a few use cases this breaks to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Velocity}: One can have a dataset of 10GB in size and a
  process that takes 30min to run over this data, this is by no means
  big-compute nor big-data; however, if a data scientist is researching
  ways to improve accuracy for their models, reducing the runtime down
  to 3min it's a 10X improvement, this improvement can lead to
  significant advances and productivity gains by increasing the velocity
  at which one can analyze data.
\item
  \textbf{Variety}: One can have an efficient process to collect data
  from many sources into a single location, usually a database, this
  process could be already running efficiently and close to realtime.
  Such processes are known at ETL (Extract-Transform-Load); data is
  extracted from multiple sources, transformed to the required format
  and loaded in a single data store. While this has worked for years,
  the tradeoff from this system is that adding a new data source is
  expensive, the system is centralized and tightly controlled. Since
  making changes to this type of systems could cause the entire process
  to come to a halt, adding new data sources usually takes long to be
  implemented. Instead, one can store all data its natural format and
  process it as needed using cluster computing, this architecture is
  currently known as a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake}{data lake}.
\end{enumerate}

Some people refer to some of these benefits as
\href{http://www.theserverside.com/feature/Handling-the-four-Vs-of-big-data-volume-velocity-variety-and-veracity}{the
four 'V's of big data}: Velocity, Variety, Volume and Veracity. Others
have gone as far as expending this to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data}{five} or even as
\href{https://tdwi.org/articles/2017/02/08/10-vs-of-big-data.aspx}{the
10 Vs of Big Data}. Mnemonics set aside, cluster computing is being used
today in more innovative ways and and is not uncommon to see
organizations experimenting with new workflows and a variety of tasks
that were traditionally uncommon for cluster computing. Much of the hype
attributed to big data falls into this space, where some will argue that
everything should be considered big data and where others will argue
than almost nothing should. My hope is that this book will help you
understand the opportunities and limitations of Apache Spark with R.

\hypertarget{r}{%
\section{R}\label{r}}

R is a computing language with it's inception dating back to Bell
Laboratories. At that time, computing was done by calling Fortran
subroutines which, apparently, were not pleasant to deal with. The S
computing language was designed as an interface language to support
higher abstractions to perform statistical computing over existing
subroutines:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{knitr}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{include_graphics}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"images/01-intro-s-algorithm-interface.png"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=22.22in]{images/01-intro-s-algorithm-interface} \caption{Interface language diagram by John Chambers from useR 2016.}\label{fig:s-diagram}
\end{figure}

R is a modern and free implementation of S, specifically:

\begin{quote}
R is a programming language and free software environment for
statistical computing and graphics.

--- \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{The R Project for Statistical
Computing}
\end{quote}

There are two strong arguments for choosing R over other computing
languages while working with data:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{R Language} was designed by statisticians for
  statisticians, meaning, this is one of the few successful languages
  designed for non-programmers; so learning R will probably feel more
  natural. Additionally, since the R language was designed to be an
  interface to other tools and languages, R allows you to focus more on
  modeling and less on the peculiarities of computer science and
  engineering.
\item
  The \textbf{R Community} provides a rich package archive provided by
  CRAN (\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{The Comprehensive R Archive
  Network}) which allows you to install ready-to-use packages to perform
  many tasks, most notably, high-quality statistic models with many only
  available in R. In addition, the R community is a welcoming and active
  group of talented individuals motivated to help you succeed. Many
  packages provided by the R community make R, by far, the place to do
  statistical computing.
\end{itemize}

One can argue to what degree other fields, like machine learning,
overlap with statistics; so far, most people will argue that the overlap
is non-trivial. Similar arguments can be made for data science, big
data, deep learning and beyond. With the continuous rise of popularity
of R, I can only expect R's influence and scope to keep growing over
time; we can take a look at the historic downloads of R packages in CRAN
to get some sense of R's recent growth (see Section
\ref{cran-downloads}):

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}Daily downloads of CRAN packages.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sparklyr}{%
\section{sparklyr}\label{sparklyr}}

Back in 2016, there was a need in the R community to support Spark
through an interface compatible with other R packages, easy to use and
available in CRAN. To this end, development of \texttt{sparklyr} started
in 2016 by RStudio under JJ Allaire, Kevin Ushey and Javier Luraschi,
version 0.4 was released in summer during the \emph{useR!} conference,
this first version added support for \texttt{dplyr}, \texttt{DBI},
modeling with \texttt{MLlib} and an extensible API that enabled
extensions like H2Os
\href{https://github.com/h2oai/rsparkling/}{rsparkling} package. Since
then, many new features have been added and support across many Spark
distributions and cloud services has made available.

Officially,

\begin{quote}
\texttt{sparklyr} is an R interface for Apache Spark.

---\href{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr}{github.com/rstudio/sparklyr}
\end{quote}

It's available in CRAN and works like any other CRAN package, meaning
that: it's agnostic to Spark versions, it's easy to install, it serves
the R community, it embraces other packages and practices from the R
community and so on. It's hosted in GitHub under
\href{github.com/rstudio/sparklyr}{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr}
and licensed under Apache 2.0 which is allows you to clone, modify and
contribute back to this project.

While thinking of who and why should use \texttt{sparklyr}, the
following roles come to mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{New Users}: For new users, I'm going to argue that
  \texttt{sparklyr} is the best way to get started with Spark. My hope
  is that the first chapters of this book will get you up running with
  ease and set you up for long term success.
\item
  \textbf{Data Scientists}: I do believe, strongly, that
  \texttt{sparklyr} in combination with many other R packages and tools
  is the most productive environment for the modern data scientists.
  \texttt{sparklyr} allows support for high-level tasks and low-level
  extensibility mechanisms to match the needs and skills of every data
  scientists.
\item
  \textbf{Expert Users}: For those users that are already immersed in
  Spark and can write code natively inScala, I'm going to argue that
  making their work available as an \texttt{sparklyr} extension is very
  desirable for them and the community. The R community is one of the
  most welcoming and supportive communities I've known, so I can't think
  of better ways of helping the expert users share their work and
  knowledge than by making it available in CRAN to R community.
\end{itemize}

This book is titled ``The R in Spark'' as a way to describe and teach
that area of overlap between Spark and R. The R package that represents
this overlap is \texttt{sparklyr}; however, the overlap goes beyond a
package. It's an overlap of communities, expectations, future
directions, packages and package extensions as well. Naming this book
\texttt{sparklyr} or ``Introduction to sparklyr'' would have left behind
a much more exciting opportunity, an opportunity to present this book as
an intersection of the R and Spark communities. Both are solving very
similar problems with a set of different skills and backgrounds;
therefore, it is my hope that \texttt{sparklyr} can be a fertile ground
for innovation, a welcoming place to newcomers, a productive place for
experienced data scientists and an open community where cluster
computing and modeling can come together.

Here are some resources to help you get involved:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Documentation}: This should be your entry point to learn more
  about sparklyr, the documentation is kept up to date with examples,
  reference functions and many more relevant resources
  (\url{https://spark.rstudio.com}).
\item
  \textbf{Github}: If you believe something needs to get fixed, open a
  GitHub issue or send us a pull request
  (\url{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr}).
\item
  \textbf{Stack Overflow}: For general questions, Stack Overflow is a
  good place to start (\url{stackoverflow.com/tags/sparklyr}).
\item
  \textbf{Gitter}: For urgent issues or to keep in touch you can chat
  with us in Gitter (\url{https://gitter.im/rstudio/sparklyr}).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{installation}{%
\chapter{Installation}\label{installation}}

From R, installing and launching a local Spark cluster using
\texttt{sparklyr} is as easy as running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_install}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, to make sure we can all run the code above and understand it,
this chapter will walk you through installing the prerequisites,
installing Spark and connecting to a local Spark cluster.

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\section{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

As briefly mentioned in the \protect\hyperlink{intro}{Introduction}
chapter, R is a programming language that can run in many platforms and
environments. Most people making use of a programming language also
choose tools to make them more productive in it; for R, RStudio would be
such tool. Strictly speaking, RStudio is an Integrated Development
Environment or IDE for short, which also happens to support many
platforms and environments. R and RStudio are the free software tools
this book will make use of and therefore, I strongly recommend you get
those installed if you haven't done so already.

Additionally, since Spark is build in the Scala programming language
which is run by the Java Virtual Machine, you also need to install Java
7 or newer in your system. It is likely that your system already has
Java installed, but is probably worth updating with the steps bellow.

\hypertarget{install-r}{%
\subsection{Install R}\label{install-r}}

From \href{https://r-project.org/}{r-project.org}, download and launch
the installer for your platform, Windows, Macs or Linux available.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/02-getting-started-download-r}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{install-java}{%
\subsection{Install Java}\label{install-java}}

From
\href{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html}{oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html},
download and launch the installer for your platform, Windows, Macs or
Linux available. While installing the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is
sufficient for most operations, in order to build extensions you will
need the JDK (Java Developer Kit); therefore, I rather recommend
installing the JDK in the first place.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/02-getting-started-jdk-8} 

}

\caption{Java Download.}\label{fig:java-download}
\end{figure}

Starting with Spark 2.1, Java 8 is required; however, previous versions
of Spark support Java 7. Regardless, we recommend installing Java 8 as
described in this chapter

\hypertarget{install-rstudio}{%
\subsection{Install RStudio}\label{install-rstudio}}

While installing RStudio is not strictly required to work with
\texttt{sparklyr} in R, it will make you much more production and
therefore, I highly recommend you take the time to install RStudio from
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/},
then download and launch the installer for your platform, Windows, Macs
or Linux available.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/02-getting-started-rstudio} 

}

\caption{RStudio Downloads.}\label{fig:rstudio-download}
\end{figure}

After launching RStudio, identify the Console panel since this is where
most of the code will be executed in this book. For additional learning
resources on R and RStudio consider visiting:
\href{https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/}{rstudio.com/online-learning/}.

\hypertarget{install-sparklyr}{%
\subsection{Install sparklyr}\label{install-sparklyr}}

First of all, we would want to install \texttt{sparkylr}. As many other
R packages, \texttt{sparklyr} is available in
\href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sparklyr}{CRAN} and can be
easily installed as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"sparklyr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The CRAN release of \texttt{sparklyr} contains the most stable version
and it's the recommended version to use; however, for those that need or
might want to try newer features being developed in \texttt{sparklyr}
you can install directly from GitHub using the \texttt{devtools}
package. First install the \texttt{devtools} package and then
\texttt{sparklyr} as follows:

\hypertarget{installing-spark}{%
\section{Installing Spark}\label{installing-spark}}

Start by loading \texttt{sparklyr},

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(sparklyr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will makes all \texttt{sparklyr} functions available in R, which is
really helpful; otherwise, we would have to run each \texttt{sparklyr}
command prefixed with \texttt{sparklyr::}.

As mentioned, Spark can be easily installed by running
\texttt{spark\_install()}; this will install the latest version of Spark
locally in your computer, go ahead and run \texttt{spark\_install()}.
Notice that this command requires internet connectivity to download
Spark.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_install}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

All the versions of Spark that are available for installation can be
displayed with \texttt{spark\_available\_versions()}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_available_versions}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##    spark
## 1  1.6.3
## 2  1.6.2
## 3  1.6.1
## 4  1.6.0
## 5  2.0.0
## 6  2.0.1
## 7  2.0.2
## 8  2.1.0
## 9  2.1.1
## 10 2.2.0
## 11 2.2.1
## 12 2.3.0
\end{verbatim}

A specific version can be installed using the Spark version and,
optionally, by also specifying the Hadoop version. For instance, to
install Spark 1.6.3, we would run \texttt{spark\_install("1.6.3")}.

You can also check which versions are installed by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_installed_versions}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, in order to uninstall an specific version of Spark you can run
\texttt{spark\_uninstall()} by specifying the Spark and Hadoop versions,
for instance:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_uninstall}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{version =} \StringTok{"1.6.0"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{hadoop =} \StringTok{"2.6"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{connecting-to-spark}{%
\section{Connecting to Spark}\label{connecting-to-spark}}

It's important to mention that, so far, we've only installed a local
Spark cluster. A local cluster is really helpful to get started, test
code and troubleshoot with ease; further chapters will explain where to
find, install and connect to real Spark clusters with many machines; but
for the first few chapters, we will focus on using local clusters.

Threfore, to connect to this local cluster we simple run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{master} parameter helps \texttt{sparklyr} find which is the
``main'' machine from the Spark cluster, this machine is often call the
driver node. While working with real clusters using many machines, most
machines will be worker machines and one will be the master. Since we
only have a local cluster with only one machine, we will default to use
\texttt{"local"} for now.

\hypertarget{using-spark}{%
\section{Using Spark}\label{using-spark}}

Now that you are connected, we can run a simple commands. For instance,
let's start by loading some text.

First, lets create a text file by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{write}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Hello World!"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hello.txt"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which we can read back in Spark by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_read_text}\NormalTok{(sc, }\StringTok{"hello"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hello.txt"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # Source:   table<hello> [?? x 1]
## # Database: spark_connection
##   line        
##   <chr>       
## 1 Hello World!
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{web-interface}{%
\subsection{Web Interface}\label{web-interface}}

Most of the Spark commands will get started from the R console; however,
it is often the case that monitoring and analizing execution is done
through Spark's web interface. This interface is a web page provided by
the driver node which can be accessed from \texttt{sparklyr} by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_web}\NormalTok{(sc)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/02-getting-started-spark-web} 

}

\caption{Apache Spark Web Interface.}\label{fig:spark-web}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{logs}{%
\subsection{Logs}\label{logs}}

Another common tool is to read through the Spark logs, a log is just a
text file where Spark will append information relevant to the execution
of tasks in the cluster. For local clusters, we can retrieve the
\texttt{sparklyr} related log entries by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_log}\NormalTok{(sc, }\DataTypeTok{filter =} \StringTok{"sparklyr"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{n =} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\hypertarget{disconnecting}{%
\section{Disconnecting}\label{disconnecting}}

For local clusters and, really, any cluster; once you are done
processing data you should disconnect by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_disconnect}\NormalTok{(sc)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

this will terminate the connection to the cluster but also terminate the
cluster tasks as well. If multiple Spark connections are active, or if
the conneciton instance \texttt{sc} is no longer available, you can also
disconnect all your Spark connections by running
\texttt{spark\_disconnect\_all()}.

\hypertarget{recap}{%
\section{Recap}\label{recap}}

This chapter walked you through installing R, Java, RStudio and
\texttt{sparklyr} as the main tools required to use Spark from R. We
covered installing local Spark clusters using \texttt{spark\_install()}
and learned how to launch the web interface using
\texttt{spark\_web(sc)} and view logs using \texttt{spark\_log(sc)}.

It is my hope that this chapter will help anyone interested in learning
cluster computing using Spark and R to get you started, ready to
experiment on your own and ready to tackle actual data analysis and
modeling tasks without any makor blockers. However, if you hit any
installation or connection issues, start by browsing online for the

\hypertarget{clusters}{%
\chapter{Clusters}\label{clusters}}

Previous chapters focused on using Spark over a single computing
instance, your personal computer. In this chapter we will introduce
techniques to run Spark over multiple computing instances, also known as
a computing cluster, to analyze data at scale.

If you already have a Spark cluster in your organization, you could
consider skipping to the next chapter,
\protect\hyperlink{connections-1}{Connections}, which will teach you how
to connect to an existing cluster.

If don't have a cluster or are considering improvements to your existing
infrastructure, this chapter will introduce some of the cluster trends,
managers and providers available today.

\hypertarget{overview-1}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview-1}}

There are three major trends in cluster computing worth discussing:
\textbf{on-premise}, \textbf{cloud computing} and \textbf{kubernetes}.
Framing these trends over time will help us understand how they came to
be, what they are and what their future might be:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1} 

}

\caption{Google trends for on-premise (mainframe), cloud computing and kubernetes.}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-21}
\end{figure}

For \textbf{on-premise} clusters, someone, either yourself or someone in
your organiation purchased physical computers that are intended to be
used for cluster computing. The computers in this cluster can made of
\emph{off-the-shelf} hardware, meaning that someone placed an order to
purchase computers usually found in stores shelves or,
\emph{high-performance} hardware, meaning that a computing vendor
provided highly customized computing hardware which also comes optimized
for high-performance network connectivity, power consumption, etc. When
purchasing hundreds or thousands of computing instances, it doesn't make
sense to keep them in the usual computing case that we are all familiar
with, but rather, it makes sense to stack them as efficient as possible
on top of each other to minimize room space. This group of efficiently
stacked computing instances is known as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_unit}{rack}. Once a cluster
grows to thousands of computers, you will also need to host hundreds of
racks of computing devices, at this scale, you would also need
significant physical space to hosts those racks. A building that
provides racks of computing instances is usually known as a
\emph{data-center}. At the scale of a data center, optimizing the
building that holds them, their heating system, power suply, network
connectivity, etc. becomes also relevant to optimize. In 2011, Facebook
\href{https://code.facebook.com/posts/187637061409082/building-efficient-data-centers-with-the-open-compute-project/}{announced}
the \href{http://www.opencompute.org/}{Open Compute Project} inniciative
which provides a set of data center blueprints free for anyone to use.

There is nothing preventing us from building our own data centers and in
fact, many organizations have followed this path. For instance, Amazon
started as an online book store, over the years Amazon grew to sell much
more than just books and, with it's online store growth, their data
centers also grew in size. In 2002, Amazon considered
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services\#History}{selling
access to virtual servers}, in their data centers to the public and, in
2004, Amazon Web Services launched as a way to let anyone rent a subset
of their datacenters on-demand, meaning that one did not have to
purchase, configure, maintain nor teardown it's own clusters but could
rather rent them from Amazon directly.

The on-demand compute model is what we know today as \textbf{Cloud
Computing}. It's a concept that evolved from Amazon Web Services
providing their data centers as a service. In the cloud, the cluster you
use is not owned by you and is neither in your physical building, but
rather, it's a data center owned and managed by someone else. Today,
there are many cloud providers in this space ranging from Amazon,
Microsoft, Google, IBM and many others. Most cloud computing platforms
provide a user interface either through a web applciation and command
line to request and manage resources.

While the bennefits of processing data in the \emph{cloud} were obvious
for many years, picking a cloud provider had the unintended side-effect
of locking organizations with one particular provider, making it hard to
switch between provideers or back to on-premise clusters.
\textbf{Kubernetes}, announced by Google in 2014, is an
\href{https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/}{open source system for
managing containerized applications across multiple hosts}. In practice,
it provides common infrastructure otherwise proprietary to cloud
providers making it much easier to deploy across multiple cloud
providers and on-premise as well. However, being a much newer paradigm
than on-premise or cloud computing, it is still in it's adoption phase
but, nevertheless, promising for cluster computing in general and,
specifically, for Apache Spark.

\hypertarget{managers}{%
\section{Managers}\label{managers}}

In order to run Spark within a computing cluster, one needs to run
something capable of initializing Spark over each compute instance, this
is known as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_manager}{cluster manager}.
The available cluster managers in Spark are: \textbf{Spark Standalone},
\textbf{YARN}, \textbf{Mesos} and \textbf{Kubernetes}.

\hypertarget{clusters-standalone}{%
\subsection{Standalone}\label{clusters-standalone}}

In \textbf{Spark Standalone}, Spark works on it's own without additional
software requirements since it provides it's own cluster manager as part
of the Spark installation.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/05-clusters-spark-standalone} 

}

\caption{Spark Standalone Site.}\label{fig:spark-standalone}
\end{figure}

By completing the \protect\hyperlink{installation}{Installation}
chapter, you should have a local Spark installation available, which we
can use to initialize a local stanalone Spark cluster. First, retrieve
the \texttt{SPARK\_HOME} directory by running
\texttt{sparklyr::spark\_home\_dir()} from R and then, from a terminal
or R, use \texttt{start-master.sh} and \texttt{start-slave.sh} as
follows:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

The previous command initialized the master node and a worker node, the
master node interface can be accessed under
\href{http://localhost:8080}{localhost:8080} and looks like the
following:

\caption{Spark Standalone Web Interface.}\label{fig:spark-standalone-web-ui}
\end{figure}

Notice that there is one worker register in Spark standalone, you can
follow the link to this worker node to see additional information:

\begin{figure}

\caption{Spark Standalone Worker Web Interface.}\label{fig:spark-standalone-web-ui-worker}
\end{figure}

Once data analysis is complete, one can simply stop all the running
nodes in this local cluster by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{stop_all <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{file.path}\NormalTok{(spark_home, }\StringTok{"sbin"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"stop-all.sh"}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A similar approach can be followed to configure a cluster by running
each \texttt{start-slave.sh} command over each machine in the cluster.

\hypertarget{yarn}{%
\subsection{Yarn}\label{yarn}}

YARN for short, or Hadoop YARN, is the resource manager introduced in
2012 to the Hadoop project. As mentioned in in the
\protect\hyperlink{intro}{Introduction} chapter, Spark was built
initially to speed up computation over Hadoop; then, when Hadoop 2 was
launched, it introduced YARN as a component to manage resources in the
cluster, to this date, using Hadoop YARN with Apache Spark is still very
common.

YARN applications can be submitted in two modes: \textbf{yarn-client}
and \textbf{yarn-cluster}. In yarn-cluster mode the driver is running
remotely, while in yarn-client mode, the driver is on the machine that
started the job, \texttt{sparklyr} supports both modes.

\section{On-Premise}\label{on-premise}}

As mentioned in the overview section, on-premise clusters represent a
set of computing instances procured, colocated and managed by staff
members from your organization. These clusters can be highly customized
and controlled; however, they can also inccur significant initial
expenses and maintenance costs.

One can use a cluster manager in on-premise clusters as described in the
previous section; however, many organizations choose to partner with
companies providing additional management software, services and
resources to manage software in their cluster including, but not limited
to, Apache Spark. Some of the on-premise cluster providers include:
Cloudera, Hortonworks and MapR to mention a few which will be briefly
introduced.

\hypertarget{cloudera}{%

\hypertarget{cloud}{%
\section{Cloud}\label{cloud}}

For those readers that don't have a cluster yet, it is likely that you
will want to choose a cloud cluster, this section will briefly mention
some of the major cloud infrastructure providers as a starting point to
choose the right one for you.

It is worth mentioning that in a cloud service model, the compute
instances are charged by the hour and times the number of instances
reserved for your cluster. Since the cluster size is flexible, it is a
good practice to start with small clusters and scale compute resources
as needed. Even if you know in advance that a cluster of significant
size will be required, starting small provides an opportunity to
troubleshoot issues at a lower cost since it's unlikely that your data
analysis will run at scale flawlessly on the first try.

The major providers of cloud computing infrastructure are: Amazon,
Google and Microsoft that this section will briefly introduce.

\hypertarget{amazon}{%
\subsection{Amazon}\label{amazon}}

Amazon provides cloud services through
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/}{Amazon Web Services}; more specifically,
they provide an on-demand Spark cluster through

\hypertarget{tools}{%
\section{Tools}\label{tools}}

While using only R and Spark can be sufficient for some clusters, it is
common to install complementary tools in your cluster to improve:
monitoring, sql analysis, workflow coordination, etc. with applications
like \href{http://ganglia.info/}{Ganglia},
\href{http://gethue.com/}{Hue} and
\href{https://oozie.apache.org}{Oozie} respectevly. This secton is not

\href{https://livy.incubator.apache.org/}{Apapche Livy} is an incubation
project in Apache providing support to use Spark clusters remotely
through a web interface. It is ideal to connect directly into the Spark
cluster; however, there are times where connecting directly to the
cluster is not feasible. When facing those constraints, one can consider
installing Livy in their cluster and secure it properly to enable remote
use over web protocols.

However, there is a significant performance overhead from using Livy in
\texttt{sparklyr} for experimentation, meaning that, executing many
client comamnds over Livy has a significant overhead; however, running a
few commands to generate complex analysis is usually performant since
the performance overhead of starting computation can be insignificant
compared to the actual cluster computation.

\hypertarget{recap-1}{%
\section{Recap}\label{recap-1}}

This chapter explained the history and tradeoffs of on-premise, cloud
computing and presented Kubernetes as a promising framework to provide
flexibility across on-premise and cloud providers. It also introduced
cluster managers (Spark Standalone, YARN, Mesos and Kubernetes) as the
software needed to run Spark as a cluster application. This chapter
briefly mentioned on-premise cluster providers like Cloudera,
Hortonworks and MapR as well as the major cloud providers: Amazon,
Google and Microsoft.

While this chapter provided a solid foundation to understand current
computing trends, cluster tools and providers useful to perform data
science; it falls short to help those tasked with deliberately choosing
a cluster manager, service provider or architecture. If you have this
task assigned to you, use this chapter as a starting point to reach to
many more resources to complete your understanding of the platform your
organization needs.

The next chapter, \protect\hyperlink{connections-1}{Connections},
assumes a Spark cluster is already available to you and will focus on
understanding how to connect to it from sparklyr.

\hypertarget{connections}{%
\chapter{Connections}\label{connections}}

The previous chapter, \protect\hyperlink{clusters}{Clusters}, presented
the major cluster computing paradigms, cluster managers and cluster
providers; this section explains the internal components of a Spark
cluster and the how to perform connections to any cluster running Apache
Spark.

\hypertarget{overview-2}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview-2}}

Before explaining how to connect to Spark clusters, it is worth
discussing the components of a Spark cluster and how they interact, this
is often known as the cluster architecture of Apache Spark.

First, lets go over a couple definitions. As you know form previous
chapters, a cluster is a collection of machines to perform analysis
beyond a single computer. However, in distributed systems and clusters
literature, we often reffer to each physical machine as a compute
instance, compute node, or simply instance or node for short. It is
helpful to remind this while reading through this chapter and making use
of external resource.

In a Spark cluster, there are three types of compute instances that are
relevant to Spark: The \textbf{driver node}, the \textbf{worker nodes}
and the \textbf{cluster manager}. A cluster manager is a service that
allos Spark to be executed in the clsuter and was explained in the
\href{Managers}{Cluster Managers} section. The driver node is tasked
with delegating work to the worker nodes, but also for aggregating their
results and iterating further if needed. For the most part, aggregation
happens in the worker nodes; however, even after the nodes aggregate
data, it is often the case that the driver node would have to aggregate
the worker results. Therefore, the driver node has at least, but often,
much more compute resources (read RAM, CPU, Local Storage, etc.) then
the worker node.

Strictly speaking, the driver node and worker nodes are just names
assigned to machines with particular roles, while the actual computation
in the driver node is performed by the \textbf{spark context}. The Spark
context is a Spark component tasked with scheduling tasks, managing data
and so on. In the worker nodes, the actual computation is performed
under a \textbf{spark executor}, which is also a Spark component tasked
with executing subtasks against a data partition.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Apache Spark Architecture}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-26}
\end{figure}

If you already have an Spark cluster in their organization, you should
ask your cluster administrator to provide connection information for
this cluster and read carefully their usage policies and constraints. A
cluster is usually shared among many users so you want to be respectful
of others time and resources while using a shared cluster environment.
Your system administrator will describe if it's an \textbf{on-premise}
vs \textbf{cloud} cluster, the \textbf{cluster manager} being used,
supported \textbf{connections} and supported \textbf{tools}. You can use
this information to jump directly to \protect\hyperlink{local}{Local},
\protect\hyperlink{standalone}{Standalone},
\protect\hyperlink{yarn-1}{Yarn}, \protect\hyperlink{mesos-1}{Mesos},
\protect\hyperlink{livy}{Livy} or
\protect\hyperlink{kubernetes-1}{Kubernetes} based on the information
provided to you.

\hypertarget{edge-nodes}{%
\subsection{Edge Nodes}\label{edge-nodes}}

Before connecting to Apache Spark, you will first have to connect to the
cluster. Usually, by connecting to an edge node within the cluster. An
edge node, is a machine that can accessed from outside the cluster but
which is also part of the cluster. There are two methods to connect to
this edge instance:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Terminal}: Using a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal}{computer
  terminal} applicaiton, one can use a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell}{secure shell} to
  establish a remote connection into the cluster, once you connect into
  the cluster, you can launch R and then use \texttt{sparklyr}.
\item
  \textbf{Web Browser}: While using \texttt{sparklyr} from a terminal is
  possible, it is usually more producty to install a \textbf{web server}
  in an edge node that provides more tools and functionality to run R
  with \texttt{sparklyr}. Most likely, you will want to consider using
  \href{RStudio\%20Server}{RStudio Server} rather than connecting from
  the terminal.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=140pt]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-27-1} 

}

\caption{Using a Spark Cluster from an Edge Node}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-27}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{spark-home}{%
\subsection{Spark Home}\label{spark-home}}

It is important to mention that, while connecting to a Spark cluster,
you will need to find out the correct \texttt{SPARK\_HOME} path which
contains the installation of Spark in the given instance. The
\texttt{SPARK\_HOME} path must be set as an environment variable before
connecting or explicitly specified in \texttt{spark\_connect()} using
the \texttt{spark\_home} parameter.

For system administrators, we recommend you set \texttt{SPARK\_HOME} for
all the users in your cluster; however, if this is not set in your
cluster you can also specify \texttt{SPARK\_HOME} while using
\texttt{spark\_connect()} as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"cluster-master"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{spark_home =} \StringTok{"local/path/to/spark"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Where \texttt{cluster-master} is set to the correct cluster manager
master for \href{Standalone}{Spark Standalone}, \href{Yarn}{YARN},
\protect\hyperlink{mesos-1}{Mesos}, etc.

\hypertarget{local}{%
\section{Local}\label{local}}

When connecting to Spark in local mode, Spark starts as a single
application simulating a cluster with a single node, this is not a
proper computing cluster but is ideal to perform work offline and
troubleshoot issues. A local connection to Spark is represented in the
following diagram:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=160pt]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-29-1} 

}

\caption{Local Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-29}
\end{figure}

Notice that in the local connections diagram, there is no cluster
manager nor worker process since, in local mode, everything runs inside
the driver application. It's also worth pointing out that
\texttt{sparklyr} starts the Spark Context through
\texttt{spark-submit}, a script available in every Spark installation to
enable users to submit custom application to Spark which
\texttt{sparklyr} makes use of to submit itself to Spark. For the
curious reader, the \protect\hyperlink{contributing}{Contributing}
chapter explains the internal processes that take place in
\texttt{sparklyr} to submit this application and connect properly from
R.

To perform this local connection, we can connect with the following
familiar code used in previous chapters:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Connect to local Spark instance}
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By default, \texttt{sparklyr}, will connect using as many CPU cores are
available in your compute instance; however, this can be customized by
connecting using \texttt{master="local{[}n{]}"}, where \texttt{n} is the
desired number of cores to use. For example, we can connect using only 2
CPU cores as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Connect to local Spark instance using 2 cores}
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local[2]"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{standalone}{%
\section{Standalone}\label{standalone}}

Connecting to a Spark Standalone cluster requires the location of the
cluster manager's master instance, this location can be found in the
cluster manager web interface as described in the
\href{standalone\%20cluster}{clusters-standalone} section, you can find
this location by looking for a URL starting with \texttt{spark://}.

A connection in standalone mode starts from \texttt{sparklyr} launching
\texttt{spark-submit} to submit the \texttt{sparklyr} application and
creating the Spark Context, which requests executors to Spark's
standalone cluster manager in the \texttt{master} location:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-32-1} 

}

\caption{Spark Standalone Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-32}
\end{figure}

In order to connect, use \texttt{master="spark://hostname:port"} in
\texttt{spark\_connect()} as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"spark://hostname:port"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{yarn-1}{%
\section{Yarn}\label{yarn-1}}

Hadoop YARN supports two connection modes: YARN Client and YARN Cluster.
However, YARN Client mode is much more common that YARN Cluster since
it's more efficient and easier to set up.

\hypertarget{yarn-client}{%
\subsection{Yarn Client}\label{yarn-client}}

When connecting in YARN Client mode, the driver instance runs R,
sparklyr and the Spark Context which requests worker nodes from YARN to
run Spark executors as follows:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-34-1} 

}

\caption{YARN Client Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-34}
\end{figure}

To connect, one can simply run with \texttt{master\ =\ "yarn"} as
follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"yarn-client"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once connected, you can use all techniques described in previous
chapters using the \texttt{sc} connection; for instances, you can do
\href{analysis}{data analysis} or
\protect\hyperlink{modeling}{modeling}.

\hypertarget{yarn-cluster}{%
\subsection{Yarn Cluster}\label{yarn-cluster}}

The main difference between YARN Cluster mode and YARN Client mode is
that in YARN Cluster mode, the driver node is not required to be the
node where R and sparklyr get started; instead, the driver node remains
the designated driver node which is usually a different node than the
edge node where R is running. It can be helpful to consider using YARN
Cluster when the edge node has too many concurrent users, is lacking
computing resources or where tools (like RStudio) need to be managed
independently of other clsuter resources.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-36-1} 

}

\caption{YARN Cluster Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-36}
\end{figure}

To connect in YARN Cluster mode, we can simple run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"yarn-cluster"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This connection assumes that the node running \texttt{spark\_connect()}
is properly configured, meaning that, \texttt{yarn-site.xml} exists and
the \texttt{YARN\_CONF\_DIR} environment variable is properly set. When
using Hadoop as a file system, one would also need the
\texttt{HADOOP\_CONF\_DIR} environment variable properly configured.
This configuration is usually provided by your system administrator and
is not something that you would have to manually configure.

\hypertarget{livy}{%
\section{Livy}\label{livy}}

As opposed to other connection methods which require using an edge node
in the cluster, \href{clusters-livy}{Livy} Livy provides a \textbf{Web
API} that makes the Spark cluster accessible from outside the cluster
and neither requires a local installation in the client. Once connected
through the Web API, the \textbf{Livy Service} starts the Spark context
by requesting reosurces from the cluster manager and distributing work
as usual.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-38-1} 

}

\caption{Livy Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-38}
\end{figure}

Conencting through Livy requires the URL to the Livy service which
should be similar to \texttt{https://hostname:port/livy}. Since remote
connections are allowed, connections usually requires, at the very
least, basic authentication:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"https://hostname:port/livy"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{method =} \StringTok{"livy"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{config =} \KeywordTok{livy_config}\NormalTok{(}
  \DataTypeTok{username=}\StringTok{"<username>"}\NormalTok{,}
  \DataTypeTok{password=}\StringTok{"<password>"}
\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Once connected through Livy, operations you can make use of an other
\texttt{sparklyr} feature; however, Livy is not suitable for
experimental data analysis, since executing commands have a significant
delay; that said, while running long running computations, this overhead
could be considered irrelevant. In general, it is preffered to avoid
using Livy and work directly within an edge node in the cluster; if this
is not feasible, using Livy could be a reasonable approach.

\hypertarget{mesos-1}{%
\section{Mesos}\label{mesos-1}}

Similar to YARN, Mesos supports client mode and a cluster mode. However,
\texttt{sparklyr} currently only supports client mode for Mesos.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-40-1} 

}

\caption{Mesos Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-40}
\end{figure}

Connecting requires the address to the Mesos master node, usually in the
form of \texttt{mesos://host:port} or
\texttt{mesos://zk://host1:2181,host2:2181,host3:2181/mesos} for Mesos
using ZooKeeper.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"mesos://host:port"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{kubernetes-1}{%
\section{Kubernetes}\label{kubernetes-1}}

Kubernetes cluster do not support client modes similar to Mesos or YARN,
instead, the connection model is similar to YARN Cluster, where the
driver node is assigned by Kubernetes.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{the-r-in-spark_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-42-1} 

}

\caption{Kubernetes Connection Diagram}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-42}
\end{figure}

Kubernetes support is scheduled to be added to \texttt{sparklyr} with
\href{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues/1525}{sparklyr/issues/1525},
please follow progress for this feature directly in github. Once
Kubernetes becomes supported in \texttt{sparklyr}, connecting to
Kubernetes will work as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}
  \DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"k8s://https://<apiserver-host>:<apiserver-port>"}
  \DataTypeTok{config =} \KeywordTok{list}\NormalTok{(}
    \DataTypeTok{spark.executor.instances =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}
    \DataTypeTok{spark.kubernetes.container.image =} \StringTok{"spark-image"}
\NormalTok{  )}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

If your computer is already configured to use a Kubernetes cluster, you
can use the following commmand to find the \texttt{apiserver-host} and
\texttt{apiserver-port}:

\begin{Shaded}

\KeywordTok{system2}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"kubectl"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"cluster-info"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\section{Multiple}\label{multiple}}

It is common to connect once, and only once, to Spark. However, you can
also open multiple connections to Spark by connecting to different
clusters or by specifying the \texttt{app\_name} parameter, this can be
helpful to compare Spark versions or validate you analysis before
submitting to the cluster. The following example opens connections to
Spark 1.6.3, 2.3.0 and Spark Standalone:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Connect to local Spark 1.6.3}
\NormalTok{sc_}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{ <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{version =} \StringTok{"1.6.3"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# Connect to local Spark 2.3.0}
\NormalTok{sc_}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{ <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{version =} \StringTok{"2.3.0"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{appName =} \StringTok{"Spark23"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# Connect to local Spark Standalone}
\NormalTok{sc_standalone <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"spark://host:port"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Finally, we can disconnect from each connection:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_disconnect}\NormalTok{(sc_}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{spark_disconnect}\NormalTok{(sc_}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{_}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{spark_disconnect}\NormalTok{(sc_standalone)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatevely, you can disconnect from all connections at once:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{spark_disconnect_all}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{recap-2}{%
\section{Recap}\label{recap-2}}

This chapter presented an overview of Spark's architecture and detailed
connections concepts and examples to connect in local mode, standalone,
YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes and Livy. It also presented edge nodes and their
role while connecting to Spark clusters. This information should give
you enough information to effectevely connect to any cluster with Apache
Spark enabled.

To troubleshoot connection problems, it is recommended to search for the
connection problem in StackOverflow, the
\href{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues}{sparklyr github
issues} and, if needed, open a
\href{https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/issues/new}{new GitHub issue
in sparklyr} to assist further.

The next chapter, \protect\hyperlink{configuration}{Configuration}, will
present the tools and best practices to configure the resources and
behavior of your Spark connection.

\hypertarget{configuration}{%
\chapter{Configuration}\label{configuration}}

\textbf{This chatper has not been written.}

The previous chapter, \protect\hyperlink{connections-1}{Connections},
explained how to connect to Spark clusters; however, it is often the
case that connection is not sufficient to run proper analysis at scale
since the default settings (say number of executors, avaialble memory,
etc) that a system administrator configured need to be modified to your
particular needs. This chapter will explain how to configure, what can
be configured and the important use cases you want to consider while
configuring your Spark environment.

\hypertarget{caching}{%
\section{Caching}\label{caching}}

Most sparklyr operations that retrieve a Spark data frame, cache the
results in-memory, for instance, running \texttt{spark\_read\_parquet()}
or \texttt{sdf\_copy\_to()} will provide a Spark dataframe that is
already cached in-memory. As a Spark data frame, this object can be used
in most sparklyr functions, including data analysis with dplyr or
machine learning.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(sparklyr)}
\NormalTok{sc <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{spark_connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{master =} \StringTok{"local"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}

\NormalTok{iris_tbl <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{sdf_copy_to}\NormalTok{(sc, iris, }\DataTypeTok{overwrite =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can inspect which tables are cached by navigating to the Spark UI
using \texttt{spark\_web(sc)}, opening the storage tab, and clicking on
a given RDD:

{\centering \includegraphics[width=13.78in]{images/07-tuning-cache-rdd-web} 

}

\caption{Cached RDD in Spark Web Interface.}\label{fig:spark-standalone-rdd-web}
\end{figure}

Data loaded in memory will be released when the R session terminates
either explicitly or implicitly with a restart or disconnection;
however, to free up resources, you can use \texttt{tbl\_uncache()}:
