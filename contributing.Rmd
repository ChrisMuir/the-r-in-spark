While there are many ways to contribute to `sparklyr` from helping community members to opening github issues, this chapter focuses on those readers interested in contributing fixes and features to `sparklyr` but will also help those who want to understand how `sparklyr` works internally.

## Overview

(architecture overview)

## Scala

Changes in the scala sources require the Scala compilers to be installed. You can install the required compilers by running:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
download_scalac()
```

Which will download the correct compilers from [https://www.scala-lang.org/](https://www.scala-lang.org).

Then you can recompile all the jars by running `configure.R` in the root of the `sparklyr` sources.
