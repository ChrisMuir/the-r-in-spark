# The R in Spark  {-}

This book teaches Apache Spark using R and focuses on helping you tackle realistic data science problems. The book intends to take someone unfamiliar with Apache Spark and help them become intermediate users of Apache Spark. While this book assumes some basic knowledge of the R language, it should be possible to follow along even without previous knowledge of R.
