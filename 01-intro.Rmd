## What is Spark?

In order to understand what Apache Spark is, we can start by browsing to the official site of this project under [spark.apache.org](http://spark.apache.org/) to find out that:

> Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.

### Large-Scale Data Processing

### General

### Fast
